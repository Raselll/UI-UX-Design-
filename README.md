# UI-UX-design-

Creation of a web app where an user can have access to the renew and redesigned University website of his course choice application.
The website was designed using Figma and the use of components and icons were exploited. The prototype created is fully functional,
meaning that it showcases navigation between windows and it is also interactive between users.
